# *Game Name*
  You are on a mission to save the galaxy, but there's only one problem...
 **your ship got off course and you're headed full speed for disaster!**
 
 ## How to Play
 There will be enemies coming towards you. Shoot them to hear a note. If done correctly, you'll hear a catchy tune. But be careful! If you let one pass by or get hit by one, you'll lose a life.
 
 The goal of the game is to survive all 4 levels. Complete them all to win!
 
 Move your mouse left/right to drive the ship, and click to shoot.
 
 **Have Fun!** üëç
